      <description>It is not hard to find online information about the archicteture of systems in big companies. How Google, Netflix,Spotify or Airbnb are solving their issues.
However, the majority of developers do not work on their scale and there is a general lack of sharing knowledge in smaller and more enterprisey systems.
For ERPs, Financial, Order Management, Logistics, Hotel Reservations and many other systems, it is pretty hard to find real life examples of how solutions were implemented and what worked or not in these cases.</description>
