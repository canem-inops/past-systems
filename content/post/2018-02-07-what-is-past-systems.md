It is not hard to find online information about the archicteture of systems in big companies. How Google, Netflix,Spotify or Airbnb are solving their issues.

However, the majority of developers do not work on their scale and there is a general lack of sharing knowledge in smaller and more enterprisey systems.

For ERPs, Financial, Order Management, Logistics, Hotel Reservations and many other systems, it is pretty hard to find real life examples of how solutions were implemented and what worked or not in these cases.

It is not a surprise that changing jobs, a developer will see the same erros being made in different shops. Ideas that seemed good at first but cannot resist the stress of running in production.

The idea of Past System is to collect experiences of these small real systems and work as a catalog of patterns and anti-patterns that can be used to help when implementing yet a new system for that.
